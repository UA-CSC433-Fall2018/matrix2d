Simple 2D matrix library

Author: Joshua Levine Email: josh@email.arizona.edu

This includes the sample code we built in class on Oct. 8 for testing out constructing complex types as C++ objects.  We construct a 2x2 matrix class that builds on a 2-dimensional vector class.  

Specifically, in class we covered how array indexing operators can work, how to construct matrices as arrays of vectors, and how these impacts the different operators

Files:

* matrix2x2.* includes the matrix class.  
* vec2.* includes the 2-dimensional vector class declaration and definition.  
* main.cpp includes some code that test's out the features of matrix2x2.
